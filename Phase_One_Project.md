### 🚀 **Project Title: International Debt Analysis Using SQL & Data Visualization**  

#### 🌍 **Project Description**  
In this project, you'll dive into **global debt trends** using the **World Bank's International Debt dataset**. The dataset gives insights into how much debt different countries owe and the types of debt they hold. You'll use **SQL queries** to explore the data, find patterns, and uncover interesting trends in global debt distribution.  

#### 🔍 **What You'll Do**  
✅ Analyze how external debt varies across different countries & regions.  
✅ Break down different **debt indicators** (long-term, short-term, etc.).  
✅ Track how global debt has changed over time.  
✅ Find out which countries have the **highest debt** and why!  

You'll be working with **PostgreSQL** to run queries and using **visualization tools** (Power BI, Tableau, Matplotlib, or Seaborn) to create stunning charts and graphs!  

#### 📂 **Dataset Source**  
The dataset comes from the **World Bank's International Debt Statistics (IDS)**, covering debt information for **120+ countries**. The dataset includes key metrics like:  
📌 **Total External Debt**  
📌 **Short-term & Long-term Debt**  
📌 **Debt Service Payments**  
📌 **Public & Private Debt Trends**  

This is your chance to level up your **SQL, data analysis, and visualization** skills with real-world financial data! 💡🔥
