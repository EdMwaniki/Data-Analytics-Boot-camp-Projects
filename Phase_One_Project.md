### **Project Title: International Debt Analysis Using SQL & Data Visualization**  

####  **Project Description**  
In this project, you'll dive into **global debt trends** using the **World Bank's International Debt dataset**. The dataset gives insights into how much debt different countries owe and the types of debt they hold. You'll use **SQL queries** to explore the data, find patterns, and uncover interesting trends in global debt distribution.  

####  **What You'll Do**  
✅ Analyze how external debt varies across different countries & regions.  
✅ Break down different **debt indicators** (long-term, short-term, etc.).  
✅ Track how global debt has changed over time.  
✅ Find out which countries have the **highest debt** and why!  

You'll be working with **PostgreSQL** to run queries and using **visualization tools** (Power BI, Tableau, Matplotlib, or Seaborn) to create stunning charts and graphs!  

####  **Dataset Source**  
The dataset comes from the **World Bank's International Debt Statistics (IDS)**, covering debt information for **120+ countries**. The dataset includes key metrics like:  
 **Total External Debt**  
 **Short-term & Long-term Debt**  
 **Debt Service Payments**  
 **Public & Private Debt Trends**  

### Project Questions 

## Objective  
Analyze global debt trends, identify the most indebted countries, compare debt patterns across different economic regions, and examine debt indicators and repayment patterns.

### **Global Debt Overview & Country Comparisons**  
#### **Objective**  
Analyze international debt trends, identify the most indebted countries, and compare debt patterns across different economic regions.  

#### **Tasks**  
- Connect to the PostgreSQL database and explore the dataset.  
- Count the number of unique countries in the dataset.  
- Identify the country with the highest total debt.  
- Find the top 5 countries with the highest debt per capita (if population data is available).  
- Compare debt trends across different economic regions (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, South Asia).  

#### **Expected Outcome**  
A report or dashboard showcasing total global debt, top debtor countries, and regional debt comparisons.

### **Debt Indicators Analysis**  
#### **Objective**  
Examine different debt indicators and determine which categories contribute most to global debt.  

#### **Tasks**  
- Extract the distinct types of debt indicators in the dataset.  
- Calculate the total debt per indicator to determine which category has the highest contribution.  
- Identify the most common debt indicator (the one that appears most frequently in the dataset).  
- Find the average debt amount per indicator.  
- Visualize the distribution of debt indicators using bar charts or SQL-driven BI tools.  

#### **Expected Outcome**  
A summary report highlighting the most and least significant debt indicators, their distribution, and their impact.

### **Debt Growth & Repayment Patterns**  
#### **Objective**  
Analyze historical debt trends and repayment patterns to understand how countries manage debt over time.  

#### **Tasks**  
- Identify the earliest and latest years covered in the dataset.  
- Calculate the total global debt per year and plot a trendline.  
- Determine which country has the highest principal repayments over time.  
- Compare the total disbursements (new debt) vs. principal repayments (debt paid off) per year.  
- Analyze how frequently countries default on repayments by detecting missing or zero repayment records.  

#### **Expected Outcome**  
A detailed report or dashboard illustrating global debt growth, repayment patterns, and debt sustainability trends across countries.
